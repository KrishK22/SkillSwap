**Description:** On Skillsy, you create a profile with your name, location (optional), and a photo if you like. Add a list of skills you can teach and skills you want to learn. 
Set when you’re available — evenings, weekends, or whenever you’re free. You can choose whether your profile is public or private.
You can search or browse other members by skill — for example, find someone who knows Photoshop or wants help with Excel.
When you find a match, you can send a swap request. The other person can accept or reject it. You’ll see all your current and pending swaps, and if you change your mind, you can delete a request anytime before it’s accepted.
After a swap, you can rate each other and leave feedback so everyone knows who’s reliable.
