# Skill Swap Platform

**Team Name:** Team Rocket  
**Problem Statement:** Skill Swap Platform  
**Team Lead Email:** guptaparth1304@gmail.com
**Description:**On Skillsy, you create a profile with your name, location (optional), and a photo if you like. Add a list of skills you can teach and skills you want to learn. Set when you’re available — evenings, weekends, or whenever you’re free. You can choose whether your profile is public or private.
You can search or browse other members by skill — for example, find someone who knows Photoshop or wants help with Excel.
When you find a match, you can send a swap request. The other person can accept or reject it. You’ll see all your current and pending swaps, and if you change your mind, you can delete a request anytime before it’s accepted.
After a swap, you can rate each other and leave feedback so everyone knows who’s reliable.
**Admins keep things fair and safe:**
1. They can reject spam or inappropriate skill posts.
2. Ban users who break the rules.
3. Monitor swap activity — pending, accepted, or cancelled.
4. Send platform-wide messages like updates or downtime alerts.
5. Download reports about user activity, feedback, and swap stats to keep the platform running smoothly.
Skillsy is about people helping people — one skill at a time.
